      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a Corporate Risk Auditor at Bank of America, I leverage my PhD in Finance and more than 10 years of experience in capital markets, market risk, and data science to conduct in-depth audits of critical models, including those for AML, economic sanctions, and fraud detection. I assess and enhance the model risk management framework within the organization and collaborate closely with stakeholders across various departments to ensure a thorough understanding of model-related risks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
